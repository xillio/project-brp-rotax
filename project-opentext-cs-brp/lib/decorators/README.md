# UDM-Standard-Decorators

This repository includes a library of the standard decorators for the Unified Data Model (UDM). These decorators are universal and many should apply to most migration projects. While the use of this library is not mandatory to use decorators, a lot of robots make use of these. Therefore it is advised to use these libraries before inventing new ones. 

This repository contains a Gradle task (_zip_) that will create a zip file containing the Xill library files in the _src_ folder. The zip will be placed in the build/distribution folder, and will be called "nl.xillio-udm-standard-decorators-[version].zip". The version number can be set in the Gradle properties file.
